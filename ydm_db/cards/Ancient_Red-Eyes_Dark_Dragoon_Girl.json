This card can only be summoned by fusing the above materials using the effect of "Ancient Power Released". When this card is fusion summoned, you can add 1 "Ancient" monster from deck to hand. Monsters you control gain 100 AtK/DEF for every "Ancient" monster in your GY. (Quick Effect) You can discard 1 card and target 1 monster your opponent controls; destroy it and if you do, deal damage to your opponent equal to half that monster's original ATK. Your opponent cannot target monsters you control for attacks or with card effects, except this card.",
