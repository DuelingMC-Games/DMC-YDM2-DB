Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card; send 1 DARK Omni monster or 1 Level 7 or lower DARK monster from your hand or Deck to the GY, then target 1 card your opponent controls; banish it, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to the sent monster’s original ATK until the end of the turn. If this card has an Omni monster as material, it gains these effects: Once per turn: When your opponent activates a card or effect, you can send 1 DARK Omni monster from your hand, field, or Deck to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card.
