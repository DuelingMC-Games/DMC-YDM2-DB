This card is unaffected by your opponent\u0027s card effects. Once per turn, during either player\u0027s turn, you can discard a card; If you do, your opponent\u0027s Main Phase is skipped. This card gains ATK and DEF equal to the number of \"Omni\" monsters in the GY or banished x1000. You cannot control any other monsters if you have this monster on the field. Once per duel, during your turn, you can discard your hand and the top 10 cards of your deck; if you do, you can destroy all other cards on the field and in your opponent\u0027s hand. Once per duel, you can send all cards in your Extra Deck to the GY; If you do, draw a card for each card sent to the GY by this effect. If this card on the field is under its owner\u0027s control, your opponent cannot use the effects of cards that would inflict damage to your Life Points.",
