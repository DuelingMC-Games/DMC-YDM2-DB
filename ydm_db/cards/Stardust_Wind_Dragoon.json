When your opponent activates the effect of a card (Quick Effect): You can discard 1 card; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card. Then, this card gains 1000 ATK/DEF. If an effect is activated that would destroy cards on the field (Quick Effect): You can tribute this card; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card. During the End Phase of this turn, if this card was tributed for this effect, you can Special Summon it from your GY, and it gains an additional 1000 ATK/DEF. You can only use each effect of "Stardust Wind Dragoon" once per turn.",
