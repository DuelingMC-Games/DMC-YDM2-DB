  "text": "This card can only be Link Summoned by using 2 or more Omni monsters with different names as Link materials. (Once per turn): You can discard 1 card from your hand; target 1 monster on the field or in either playerâ€™s GY; banish it. If a monster is banished by this effect, this card gains ATK equal to the banished monster's original ATK until the end of the turn. If a Spell/Trap is banished, destroy 1 card your opponent controls. (Once per turn): If this card is Link Summoned using Omni monsters as materials, you can add 1 Omni monster from your Deck or GY to your hand, or Special Summon it if its Level is 6 or lower. (Quick Effect): During either player's turn, when an effect that would destroy a card on the field is activated, you can tribute 1 Omni monster from your field or hand to negate the activation. If you do, destroy that card and inflict 1000 points of damage to your opponent. (Once per turn): During your Main Phase, you can banish 1 Omni monster from your GY; this card gains ATK equal to the banished monster's original ATK until the end of the turn. You can also target 1 card your opponent controls and return it to the hand. If this card is destroyed by battle or card effect, you can Special Summon 1 Omni monster from your GY. That monster gains 1500 ATK, and you can equip \"Cyber Link Dragoon Lord\" to it as material.",
