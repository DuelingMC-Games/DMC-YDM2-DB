Once per turn (Quick Effect): When your opponent activates a card or effect, you can banish 1 monster from your GY or Tribute 1 monster you control; negate the activation, and if you do, banish that card. If this card is Tributed or banished by its own effect: During the End Phase, you can Special Summon this card from your GY. When you do, this card gains 1000 ATK/DEF and becomes unaffected by your opponent’s card effects until the end of your next turn.
